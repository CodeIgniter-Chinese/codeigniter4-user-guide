Installation
############

CodeIgniter4 can be installed in a number of different ways: manually,
using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_, or using
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_. 
Which is right for you?

- If you would like the simple "download & go" install that CodeIgniter3
  is known for, choose the manual installation.
- If you plan to add third party packages to your project, we
  recommend the Composer installation.
- If you are thinking of contributing to the framework,
  then the Git installation is right for you.

However you choose to install and run CodeIgniter4, the 
`user guide <https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/>`_ is accessible online.

.. note:: Before using CodeIgniter 4, make sure that your server meets the
          :doc:`requirements </intro/requirements>`, in particular the PHP
          version and the PHP extensions that are needed.
          You may find that you have to uncomment the ``php.ini`` "extension"
          lines to enable "curl" and "intl", for instance.
