CodeIgniter was originally developed by `EllisLab  <https://ellislab.com/>`_.
The framework was written for performance in the real world,
with many of the original class libraries, helpers, and
sub-systems borrowed from the code-base of `ExpressionEngine
<https://expressionengine.com>`_.
It was, for years, developed and maintained by EllisLab, the ExpressionEngine
Development Team and a group of community members called the Reactor Team.

In 2014, CodeIgniter was acquired by the `British Columbia Institute of Technology
<https://www.bcit.ca/>`_ and was then officially announced as a community-maintained
project.

Bleeding edge development is spearheaded by the handpicked contributors
of the CodeIgniter Council.
